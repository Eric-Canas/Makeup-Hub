# MakeupHub

Draw a beautiful makeup on your face and share it with others.

Makeup-Hub allows you to paint and put some stickers your face, and see how it looks in you or your friends faces from any perspective. In a close future it will also allow you to upload this makeup to a cloud where you could also try how other users makeups looks in your face. Additionally it have an option for <i>moonifying</i> your face, which is really to see how it looks in a plain perspective that is used internally, but is pretty funny :full_moon_with_face:. Everything runs on frontend, so no images are sent to the server.

### Quick Start

Simply run the <a href="./src/public/play.html" target="_blank">./src/public/play.html</a> in server mode.

Turn on your **webcam** click on **Makeup!** and draw a beatiful artwork on your face.
